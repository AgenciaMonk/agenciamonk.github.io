  "readme": "# yazl\n\nyet another zip library for node. For unzipping, see\n[yauzl](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yauzl).\n\nDesign principles:\n\n * Don't block the JavaScript thread.\n   Use and provide async APIs.\n * Keep memory usage under control.\n   Don't attempt to buffer entire files in RAM at once.\n * Prefer to open input files one at a time than all at once.\n   This is slightly suboptimal for time performance,\n   but avoids OS-imposed limits on the number of simultaneously open file handles.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar yazl = require(\"yazl\");\n\nvar zipfile = new yazl.ZipFile();\nzipfile.addFile(\"file1.txt\", \"file1.txt\");\n// (add only files, not directories)\nzipfile.addFile(\"path/to/file.txt\", \"path/in/zipfile.txt\");\n// pipe() can be called any time after the constructor\nzipfile.outputStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\"output.zip\")).on(\"close\", function() {\n  console.log(\"done\");\n});\n// alternate apis for adding files:\nzipfile.addReadStream(process.stdin, \"stdin.txt\", {\n  mtime: new Date(),\n  mode: parseInt(\"0100664\", 8), // -rw-rw-r--\n});\nzipfile.addBuffer(new Buffer(\"hello\"), \"hello.txt\", {\n  mtime: new Date(),\n  mode: parseInt(\"0100664\", 8), // -rw-rw-r--\n});\n// call end() after all the files have been added\nzipfile.end();\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Class: ZipFile\n\n#### new ZipFile()\n\nNo parameters.\nNothing can go wrong.\n\n#### addFile(realPath, metadataPath, [options])\n\nAdds a file from the file system at `realPath` into the zipfile as `metadataPath`.\nTypically `metadataPath` would be calculated as `path.relative(root, realPath)`.\nUnzip programs would extract the file from the zipfile as `metadataPath`.\n`realPath` is not stored in the zipfile.\n\nA valid `metadataPath` must not be blank.\nIf a `metadataPath` contains `\"\\\\\"` characters, they will be replaced by `\"/\"` characters.\nAfter this substitution, a valid `metadataPath` must not start with `\"/\"` or `/[A-Za-z]:\\//`,\nand must not contain `\"..\"` path segments.\nFile paths must not end with `\"/\"`.\n\n`options` may be omitted or null and has the following structure and default values:\n\n```js\n{\n  mtime: stats.mtime,\n  mode: stats.mode,\n  compress: true,\n  forceZip64Format: false,\n}\n```\n\nUse `mtime` and/or `mode` to override the values\nthat would normally be obtained by the `fs.Stats` for the `realPath`.\nThe mode is the unix permission bits and file type.\nThe mtime and mode are stored in the zip file in the fields \"last mod file time\",\n\"last mod file date\", and \"external file attributes\".\nyazl does not store group and user ids in the zip file.\n\nIf `compress` is `true`, the file data will be deflated (compression method 8).\nIf `compress` is `false`, the file data will be stored (compression method 0).\n\nIf `forceZip64Format` is `true`, yazl will use ZIP64 format in this entry's Data Descriptor\nand Central Directory Record regardless of if it's required or not (this may be useful for testing.).\nOtherwise, yazl will use ZIP64 format where necessary.\n\nInternally, `fs.stat()` is called immediately in the `addFile` function,\nand `fs.createReadStream()` is used later when the file data is actually required.\nThroughout adding and encoding `n` files with `addFile()`,\nthe number of simultaneous open files is `O(1)`, probably just 1 at a time.\n\n#### addReadStream(readStream, metadataPath, [options])\n\nAdds a file to the zip file whose content is read from `readStream`.\nSee `addFile()` for info about the `metadataPath` parameter.\n`options` may be omitted or null and has the following structure and default values:\n\n```js\n{\n  mtime: new Date(),\n  mode: parseInt(\"0100664\", 8),\n  compress: true,\n  forceZip64Format: false,\n  size: 12345, // example value\n}\n```\n\nSee `addFile()` for the meaning of `mtime`, `mode`, `compress`, and `forceZip64Format`.\nIf `size` is given, it will be checked against the actual number of bytes in the `readStream`,\nand an error will be emitted if there is a mismatch.\n\nNote that yazl will `.pipe()` data from `readStream`, so be careful using `.on('data')`.\nIn certain versions of node, `.on('data')` makes `.pipe()` behave incorrectly.\n\n#### addBuffer(buffer, metadataPath, [options])\n\nAdds a file to the zip file whose content is `buffer`.\nSee below for info on the limitations on the size of `buffer`.\nSee `addFile()` for info about the `metadataPath` parameter.\n`options` may be omitted or null and has the following structure and default values:\n\n```js\n{\n  mtime: new Date(),\n  mode: parseInt(\"0100664\", 8),\n  compress: true,\n  forceZip64Format: false,\n}\n```\n\nSee `addFile()` for the meaning of `mtime`, `mode`, `compress`, and `forceZip64Format`.\n\nThis method has the unique property that General Purpose Bit `3` will not be used in the Local File Header.\nThis doesn't matter for unzip implementations that conform to the Zip File Spec.\nHowever, 7-Zip 9.20 has a known bug where General Purpose Bit `3` is declared an unsupported compression method\n(note that it really has nothing to do with the compression method.).\nSee [issue #11](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yazl/issues/11).\nIf you would like to create zip files that 7-Zip 9.20 can understand,\nyou must use `addBuffer()` instead of `addFile()` or `addReadStream()` for all entries in the zip file\n(and `addEmptyDirectory()` is fine too).\n\nNote that even when yazl provides the file sizes in the Local File Header,\nyazl never uses ZIP64 format for Local File Headers due to the size limit on `buffer` (see below).\n\n##### Size limitation on buffer\n\nIn order to require the ZIP64 format for a local file header,\nthe provided `buffer` parameter would need to exceed `0xfffffffe` in length.\nAlternatively, the `buffer` parameter might not exceed `0xfffffffe` in length,\nbut zlib compression fails to compress the buffer and actually inflates the data to more than `0xfffffffe` in length.\nBoth of these scenarios are not allowed by yazl, and those are enforced by a size limit on the `buffer` parameter.\n\nAccording to [this zlib documentation](http://www.zlib.net/zlib_tech.html),\nthe worst case compression results in \"an expansion of at most 13.5%, plus eleven bytes\".\nFurthermore, some configurations of Node.js impose a size limit of `0x3fffffff` on every `Buffer` object.\nRunning this size through the worst case compression of zlib still produces a size less than `0xfffffffe` bytes,\n\nTherefore, yazl enforces that the provided `buffer` parameter must be at most `0x3fffffff` bytes long.\n\n#### addEmptyDirectory(metadataPath, [options])\n\nAdds an entry to the zip file that indicates a directory should be created,\neven if no other items in the zip file are contained in the directory.\nThis method is only required if the zip file is intended to contain an empty directory.\n\nSee `addFile()` for info about the `metadataPath` parameter.\nIf `metadataPath` does not end with a `\"/\"`, a `\"/\"` will be appended.\n\n`options` may be omitted or null and has the following structure and default values:\n\n```js\n{\n  mtime: new Date(),\n  mode: 040775,\n}\n```\n\nSee `addFile()` for the meaning of `mtime` and `mode`.\n\n#### end([options], [finalSizeCallback])\n\nIndicates that no more files will be added via `addFile()`, `addReadStream()`, or `addBuffer()`.\nSome time after calling this function, `outputStream` will be ended. Note that this entails that you cannot rely on this\ncallback to know when you are done producing output. If for instance you are creating a zip archive on disk, you will need\nto listen to the `end` event on the `outputStream` before notifying consumers of that file.\n\n`options` may be omitted or null and has the following structure and default values:\n\n```js\n{\n  forceZip64Format: false,\n}\n```\n\nIf `forceZip64Format` is `true`, yazl will include the ZIP64 End of Central Directory Locator\nand ZIP64 End of Central Directory Record regardless of whether or not they are required\n(this may be useful for testing.).\nOtherwise, yazl will include these structures if necessary.\n\nIf specified and non-null, `finalSizeCallback` is given the parameters `(finalSize)`\nsometime during or after the call to `end()`.\n`finalSize` is of type `Number` and can either be `-1`\nor the guaranteed eventual size in bytes of the output data that can be read from `outputStream`.\n\nIf `finalSize` is `-1`, it means means the final size is too hard to guess before processing the input file data.\nThis will happen if and only if the `compress` option is `true` on any call to `addFile()`, `addReadStream()`, or `addBuffer()`,\nor if `addReadStream()` is called and the optional `size` option is not given.\nIn other words, clients should know whether they're going to get a `-1` or a real value\nby looking at how they are using this library.\n\nThe call to `finalSizeCallback` might be delayed if yazl is still waiting for `fs.Stats` for an `addFile()` entry.\nIf `addFile()` was never called, `finalSizeCallback` will be called during the call to `end()`.\nIt is not required to start piping data from `outputStream` before `finalSizeCallback` is called.\n`finalSizeCallback` will be called only once, and only if this is the first call to `end()`.\n\n#### outputStream\n\nA readable stream that will produce the contents of the zip file.\nIt is typical to pipe this stream to a writable stream created from `fs.createWriteStream()`.\n\nInternally, large amounts of file data are piped to `outputStream` using `pipe()`,\nwhich means throttling happens appropriately when this stream is piped to a slow destination.\n\nData becomes available in this stream soon after calling one of `addFile()`, `addReadStream()`, or `addBuffer()`.\nClients can call `pipe()` on this stream at any time,\nsuch as immediately after getting a new `ZipFile` instance, or long after calling `end()`.\n\nAs a reminder, be careful using both `.on('data')` and `.pipe()` with this stream.\nIn certain versions of node, you cannot use both `.on('data')` and `.pipe()` successfully.\n\n### dateToDosDateTime(jsDate)\n\n`jsDate` is a `Date` instance.\nReturns `{date: date, time: time}`, where `date` and `time` are unsigned 16-bit integers.\n\n## Regarding ZIP64 Support\n\nyazl automatically uses ZIP64 format to support files and archives over `2^32 - 2` bytes (~4GB) in size\nand to support archives with more than `2^16 - 2` (65534) files.\n(See the `forceZip64Format` option in the API above for more control over this behavior.)\nZIP64 format is necessary to exceed the limits inherent in the original zip file format.\n\nZIP64 format is supported by most popular zipfile readers, but not by all of them.\nNotably, the Mac Archive Utility does not understand ZIP64 format (as of writing this),\nand will behave very strangely when presented with such an archive.\n\n## Output Structure\n\nThe Zip File Spec leaves a lot of flexibility up to the zip file creator.\nThis section explains and justifies yazl's interpretation and decisions regarding this flexibility.\n\nThis section is probably not useful to yazl clients,\nbut may be interesting to unzip implementors and zip file enthusiasts.\n\n### Disk Numbers\n\nAll values related to disk numbers are `0`,\nbecause yazl has no multi-disk archive support.\n(The exception being the Total Number of Disks field in\nthe ZIP64 End of Central Directory Locator, which is always `1`.)\n\n### Version Made By\n\nAlways `0x033f == (3 << 8) | 63`, which means UNIX (3)\nand made from the spec version 6.3 (63).\n\nNote that the \"UNIX\" and has implications in the External File Attributes.\n\n### Version Needed to Extract\n\nUsually `20`, meaning 2.0. This allows filenames to be UTF-8 encoded.\n\nWhen ZIP64 format is used, some of the Version Needed to Extract values will be `45`, meaning 4.5.\nWhen this happens, there may be a mix of `20` and `45` values throughout the zipfile.\n\n### General Purpose Bit Flag\n\nBit `8` is always set.\nFilenames are always encoded in utf8, even if the result is indistinguishable from ascii.\n\nBit `3` is usually set in the Local File Header.\nTo support both a streaming input and streaming output api,\nit is impossible to know the crc32 before processing the file data.\nWhen bit `3` is set, data Descriptors are given after each file data with this information, as per the spec.\nBut remember a complete metadata listing is still always available in the central directory record,\nso if unzip implementations are relying on that, like they should,\nnone of this paragraph will matter anyway.\nEven so, some popular unzip implementations do not follow the spec.\nThe Mac Archive Utility requires Data Descriptors to include the optional signature,\nso yazl includes the optional data descriptor signature.\nWhen bit `3` is not used, the Mac Archive Utility requires there to be no data descriptor, so yazl skips it in that case.\nAdditionally, 7-Zip 9.20 does not seem to support bit `3` at all\n(see [issue #11](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yazl/issues/11)).\n\nAll other bits are unset.\n\n### Internal File Attributes\n\nAlways `0`.\nThe \"apparently an ASCII or text file\" bit is always unset meaning \"apparently binary\".\nThis kind of determination is outside the scope of yazl,\nand is probably not significant in any modern unzip implementation.\n\n### External File Attributes\n\nAlways `stats.mode << 16`.\nThis is apparently the convention for \"version made by\" = `0x03xx` (UNIX).\n\nNote that for directory entries (see `addEmptyDirectory()`),\nit is conventional to use the lower 8 bits for the MS-DOS directory attribute byte.\nHowever, the spec says this is only required if the Version Made By is DOS,\nso this library does not do that.\n\n### Directory Entries\n\nWhen adding a `metadataPath` such as `\"parent/file.txt\"`, yazl does not add a directory entry for `\"parent/\"`,\nbecause file entries imply the need for their parent directories.\nUnzip clients seem to respect this style of pathing,\nand the zip file spec does not specify what is standard in this regard.\n\nIn order to create empty directories, use `addEmptyDirectory()`.\n\n## Change History\n\n * 2.4.2\n   * Remove octal literals to make yazl compatible with strict mode.
